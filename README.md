## Data

The data we will be working with today is a combination of toy data published with Vince Buffalo's [*Bioinformatics Data Skills* book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do) and subsets of data from projects I have worked on. See below for a more detailed description of where each dataset came from.
